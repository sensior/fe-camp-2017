            <th>Now I may have a strong interest in programming,or maybe i just like the<br/>things related to computer,
                whatever.As I'm not sure what life ways<br/>I will have or I would like to have in the future,I want to 
                try as much as possible<br/>in the next four years.Maybe the road to be an excellent programmer(or better)<br/>
                is tough,I still want to challenge myself.I hope that<br/> I will find the thing to which I am willing to 
                devote my life sooner<br/> AND I really hope that programming will be the answer.<br/>Let me set a small goal
                for myself now:<br/> Join the HUST's ACM Team and to be qualified to participate in the World Final Game(WOW!)
